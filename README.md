# Recipe Bank

The app will show recipes by fetching recipes from an API. The URL is: `https://api.sampleapis.com/recipes/recipes`

Here are the requirements:

1. Breakup the UI (User Interface) to components to avoid duplicating HTML
1. It must fetch recipes from the recipes API
1. When the fetching component is unmounted, write to the console 'Unmounted'
1. For each recipe, it will show the title, description, ingredients, and directions
1. When clicking on a recipe in the list, update the document title to show the title of the clicked recipe
1. You will need to add the navbar and footer
1. Use the HTML and CSS below for an idea of how it should look

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
